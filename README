My feeble attempt to replicate http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/examples/todos/index.html
using Application Craft http://www.applicationcraft.com/

I first version is here: http://acft.ws/bpwp.  
All the logic was contained in the event handlers and it made it difficult to maintain.  
After reviewing the Backbone.js example I wanted to address my lack of design.

The final version is here: http://acft.ws/buns
My design follows what I am calling Model View Presenter. 
I document the code and design here: http://bit.ly/xNNxJ7


The features supported

- Add todo with Enter
- Mark todo for deletion
- Immediately delete row using icon on row
- Update in place
- Messages at the bottom show status
- Browser Local storage support
- Italize text when marked for deletion

Enjoy!
