My feeble attempt to replicate http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/examples/todos/index.html
using Application Craft http://www.applicationcraft.com/

You can see my running app here: http://acft.ws/bpwp

The features supported

- Add todo with Enter
- Mark todo for deletion
- Immediately delete row using icon on row
- Update in place
- Messages at the bottom show status
- Browser Local storage support
- Italize text when marked for deletion

Enjoy!
