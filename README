My feeble attempt to replicate http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/examples/todos/index.html
using Application Craft http://www.applicationcraft.com/

The first version is here: http://acft.ws/bpwp.  
All the logic was contained in the event handlers and it made it difficult to maintain.  
After reviewing the Backbone.js example I wanted to address my lack of design.

The final version is here: http://acft.ws/buns
My design follows what I am calling Model View Presenter. 
I document the code and design here: http://bit.ly/xNNxJ7

Venues - My first implementation using MVP.  This was a proof of concept.  
         Venues gets a feed from Foursquare using the lat/long and displays it
         on map.  Interaction between Categories and Sub-categories controls the map.
         As the mouse flys over the Markers, the Venue detail is displayed.
         Popular places (by count of Foursquare users present) are summarized by count.
